#Barc Start
This is a trial Android app for the Barc Mobile Calendar App. 
I am using [Caldroid](https://github.com/roomorama/Caldroid) to generate monthly calendar and [Android-Week-View](https://github.com/alamkanak/Android-Week-View) to generate weekly calendar. 

The basic functions are 1. record daily diet/exercise, 2. chat with the trainer, and 3. make a PT appointment with the trainer. 

I'll be using Firebase to keep track of data.
